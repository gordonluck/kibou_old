```html
<ul class="links">
  <li>
    <a href="//some.link" target="_blank">
      <img src="//path.to/avatar.png">
      <span>Your Friend's Name</span>
    </a>
  </li>
<ul>
```

### Frosted Glass Effect

The frosted glass effect can be enabled for Safari users only.

The effect was made compatible for **Chrome** and **Firefox** users by @moriW. I appreciate his work.

However, this effect is **no longer supported** by theme Kibou, due to many reports of glitches and malfunctions. This effect seems to cause some browsers, including Chrome and certain Chinese Browsers, to slow down and may even crash on certain PCs.

The effect is still available in the [frosted-glass branch](https://github.com/metheno/typecho-theme-kibou/tree/frosted-glass), but the theme is at an older version, and will not be supported in future releases.

### Plugin style optimization

The theme is now optimized for or compatible with the following plugins:

- [APlayer](https://github.com/DIYgod/APlayer/) support - style optimization
- [DPlayer](https://github.com/DIYgod/DPlayer/) support - style optimization
- [TePostView](https://lixianhua.com/typecho_viewsnum_plugin.html) support - add compatibility

## Known Issues

The following issues are known:

- Render with extended Markdown causes APlayer and DPlayer to work incorrectly.

The reason why above issues exist is because that I'm too young.
